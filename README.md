# Temperature-Control-System

By using Atmega16 microcontroller the fan is automatically turned ON or OFF according to the temperature.

If the temperature is less than 30C turn off the fan.
If the temperature is greater than or equal 30C turn on the fan with 25% of its maximum speed.
If the temperature is greater than or equal 60C turn on the fan with 50% of its maximum speed.
If the temperature is greater than or equal 90C turn on the fan with 75% of its maximum speed.
If the temperature is greater than or equal 120C turn on the fan with 100% of its maximum speed.
